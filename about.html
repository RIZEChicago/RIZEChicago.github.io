	Origins of RIZE:
 
Born and raised on the South-side of Chicago, I am both blessed and humbled by my upbringing. I grew up in an environment that consisted of cultural diversity that was faced with daily adversity. Whether it was dealing with school, family issues, drugs, or gang activity, I knew many individuals who encountered various problems in their daily life. Even though I wasn’t personally affected by all of these issues, I personally knew people where were. To some degree, everyone faces hardships. It’s those people who were able to conquer that hardship that inspired me to start RIZE Chicago. No matter the adversity you face in your life, here at RIZE Chicago, we want you to know that you can RIZE above it.
 
We are RIZE Chicago; an urban street-style clothing brand instilled with Chicago soul. We want to see Chicago RIZE, which is why a percentage of every profit we make goes to Kids Off The Block, whose mission is “to reach the most at risk youth in the area and provide them with access to a wider society and out of self destruction and economic impoverishment”. When you wear our clothes, you are representing an idea. When you wear our clothes you are becoming a part of something bigger.  When you put that shirt on, you are becoming part of the solution, and you look damn good while you do it.
 
RIZE up and #SaveChicago.
Thank you,
 
Max Donkel
             CEO - RIZE  A Chicago Company
